# Last Wish Wish Wall Website
--INACTIVE--

Formerly for a collaboratiion treasure hunt/puzzle made for and by members of the Destiny 2 Last Wish/Raid community.

Features
- working wish wall replica
- does not activate anything when codes are inputted
- basically just a cool clicky website with no real use

Don't know if I'll ever come back to this since the whole project got scrapped, and not sure what I would do with this outside of that, but it was a good learning tool for interesting dynamic JavaScript applications in HTML
